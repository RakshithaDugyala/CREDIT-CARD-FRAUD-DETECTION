# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
In this project, I have done a comprehensive exploration and modeling approach to transaction data from the fraudTrain.csv dataset, with the goal of identifying patterns associated with fraudulent activity. Initially, it performs data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Standard libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are employed to manipulate data and create visualizations. The dataset is imported, and its structure is examined through operations like viewing data samples, checking dimensions, and understanding feature types. The data is then cleaned by removing null values and dropping irrelevant or sensitive columns such as names, credit card numbers, addresses, and timestamps, which are not required for modeling. A statistical summary of the cleaned dataset is provided using descriptive methods, and a custom function is introduced to classify the features into categories such as categorical, non-categorical, discrete, and continuous, depending on their data types and unique value counts.

Following the EDA, the notebook transitions into a machine learning phase to build predictive models for fraud detection. The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split, and class imbalance (a common issue in fraud detection) is addressed using resampling techniques like SMOTE or similar (exact technique can be confirmed from full code). Multiple classification algorithms are implemented to evaluate their performance in identifying fraudulent transactions. These include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) â€” each trained on the resampled training data. The models are evaluated using accuracy metrics and prediction results on the test set. Logistic Regression, for example, is trained and evaluated with both training and test accuracy scores reported.
